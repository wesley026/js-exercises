# Exercise 05 - sumAll

Implement a function that takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every number between(and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4) // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```


## Hints

Think about how you would do this on pen and paper and then how you might translate that process into code:
- make sure you pay attention to the function parameters
- create a variable to hold the final sum
- loop through the given numbers ([link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration))
- on each iteration add the number to the sum
- return the sum after finishing the loop

edge cases
1. if either of them are negatives 
2. if they are not numbers or integers
3. if larger number is inputted first , hence use min , max functions
